## Understanding Results

### Inspection Results

#### PASS Result Example
```
Inspection #1,245
========================================

‚úì No defects found
PCB PASSED

Processing Time: 0.08 seconds
Focus Score: 165.2
```

#### FAIL Result Example
```
Inspection #1,246
========================================

Found 2 defects:

1. Missing Hole (Confidence: 92.3%)
2. Spur (Confidence: 87.6%)

Processing Time: 0.12 seconds
Focus Score: 142.8
```

### Defect Visualization

Defects are marked on the inspection image with:
- **Colored bounding boxes** around defect areas
- **Labels** showing defect type and confidence
- **Consistent color coding** for easy identification

#### Color Coding
- üî¥ **Red**: Missing Hole
- üü† **Orange**: Mouse Bite  
- üü° **Yellow**: Open Circuit
- üü£ **Magenta**: Short Circuit
- üîµ **Cyan**: Spur
- üü£ **Purple**: Spurious Copper

### Confidence Scores

Each defect detection includes a confidence score (0-100%):
- **>90%**: Very high confidence - defect is almost certainly present
- **80-90%**: High confidence - defect is likely present
- **70-80%**: Moderate confidence - review recommended
- **<70%**: Low confidence - manual verification required

### When to Question Results

Consider manual verification if:
- Confidence score is below 80%
- Defect appears very small or unclear
- PCB design has unusual features
- Lighting conditions were poor during inspection
